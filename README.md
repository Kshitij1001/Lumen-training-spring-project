Package client_app, donor-service and camp-service with maven with package command.
Run donor-service's .jar file first with "java -jar" command
then run other .jar files since donor-service is maintaining the eureka registry

The client UI will be available at http://localhost:8080
To check registered services on eureka server, open http://localhost:8761

NOTE: Some application features are yet to implement...
